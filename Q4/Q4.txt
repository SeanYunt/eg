Q4. Write the code for the following function, without using any built-in functions. Java or
C# is preferred). 

String itoa(int value, int base);

Where value is the integer to convert, and base is octal, decimal, or hex.
Please include any tests that are necessary to validate this function using the automated
test library of your choice.

ASSUMPTIONS

Java is probably the language I have the most experience with, and I am familiar with various helper libraries that would have made this simple.
However I wanted to challenge myself and implement this from scratch.

CHALLENGES

I only got this partially working. The number bases convert nicely when the string output uses decimal digits.
I couldn't find a clean way in to incorporate non-decimal digits.
e.g. 10 decimal would be "a" in hexadecimal.
For integrity sake I left the failing test in the suite.

I experimented with mapping to an array of characters and incrementing an index to track where the number base system ended, but that introduced more bugs than this limited implementation.  I do think that was the correct course to pursue if I were to continue.


PROJECT NOTES

For the implementation please see: src/main/java/net/yunt/Q4.java

The test is located at: src/test/java/net/yunt/Q4Test.java

To execute the test please run:
mvn install
