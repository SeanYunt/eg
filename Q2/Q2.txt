Test specification for Github API: list public repros for a given user

Scope and Assumptions

Github production API is live and available.
Known good user accounts will be used for happy path
Non-existing user accounts
Bad syntax values for user accounts

Tools
Java+TestNG unit testing framework.
RestAssured HTTP library for RESTful test assertions

Rationale for tool selection 

TestNG
Many, many tools are able to programmatically deal with the output format from JUnit/TestNG. These include IDEs, and CI/CD tools like Jenkins.
This immediately spares us much work to manage result reporting. TestNG also supports the DataProvider pattern, where we can execute our tests in a "for each" pattern.
The parameter inputs for this data driven tests can be statically defined in the test code, read from external I/O (file, DB) or potentially dynamically generated at runtime.

RestAssured
While there exist many HTTP clients that work well within the TestNG unit test framework, given the REST api we are testing, RestAssured gives us some helpful abstractions.
When writing the test, you can use a behavioral driven approach, similar to how a test case might be read in English.
For example:

	public void testAcccountExists() throws Exception {
		RestAssured.given().
		header("Accept", "application/vnd.github.v3+json"	). 
	    when().
	        get("https://api.github.com/users/SeanYunt/repos").
	    then().
            contentType(ContentType.JSON).
	    	statusCode(200).
	    	body("owner.login[0]",equalTo("SeanYunt"));
	} 

Using that pattern we can quickly introduce new test cases that are driven by input parameters like HTTP headers, query parameters and paths.
It would also be trivial to pair expected values for assertions with input parameters.

Test Cases

Given a user account "SeanYunt" make an HTTP GET request to https://api.github.com/users/SeanYunt/repos
then verify the following:

HTTP response code == 200
A valid JSON document is returned
For the first project in the document verify the following JSONPath values:
owner.login == SeanYunt
id == 118155790
name == Apex_Sandbox
full_name == SeanYunt/Apex_Sandbox
html_url == https://github.com/SeanYunt/Apex_Sandbox
private == false
default_branch == master
... and so on for all mandatory elements in the JSON
